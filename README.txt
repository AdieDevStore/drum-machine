This is my take on the Free Code Camp drum machine exercise

I mainly used this an exercise to re-learn CSS. 
I have made many mistakes and probably did not use React the way it should have been used, but I have learned a lot

Feel free to have a look! 

** FOR EDWIN ** 

I will have a section here for you on how to copy and this project to work using npm soon
